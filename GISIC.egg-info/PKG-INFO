        This package performs normalization of astronomical spectra based on a continuum identification routine.
        GISIC performs a gaussian smoothing of the flux array, and identifies molecular bands based on a numerical gradient. Continuum points are then interpolated with a cubic spline.
        
        ```python
        import GISIC
        ```
        ```python
        wave, norm_flux, continuum = GISIC.normalize(wave, flux, sigma=30)
        ```
